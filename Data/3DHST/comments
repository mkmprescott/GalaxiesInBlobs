On Agnar's computer, this folder contains all the raw 3D-HST data downloaded from the 3D-HST website. 
While Agnar would very much like to back up that data onto Github, most of the files have sizes greater 
  than 25 MiB, making it impossible to upload them here. This includes everything in the following folders: 
  
AEGIS
COSMOS
GOODSN*
GOODSS*
UDS
3DHSTimages*
3DHST_MASTER
CSVcatalogs

Folders marked with asterisks are ones that contain files currently used by LIONS. (The CSVcatalogs
  folder might also fall into this category, but Agnar doesn't remember. It probably doesn't.) 
There is one folder that contains files small enough to put onto GitHub, but unfortunately it isn't
  useful for LIONS analysis and probably never will be: the psfs folder. Because it isn't useful, it
  will not be uploaded here.
