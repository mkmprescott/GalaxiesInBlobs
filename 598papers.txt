for 1/28: 
Matsuda et al. 2011 (The Subaru Lya blob survey: a sample of 100-kpc Lya blobs at z=3): 
The authors took images with the Subaru Suprime-Cam of 12 fields in the sky looking for Lya blobs (LABs) at z~3. 
They found 14 giant (100-200 kpc) LABs in these images, which almost tripled the number of giant LABs known. 
When looking for overdensities in the images, they found that blobs that are more elongated and filament-shaped 
tended to be located in average-density environment, while rounder, more spherical blobs are found in both average 
and overdense environments. This suggests that blobs may follow a morphology-density relation.
