Matsuda et al. 2011 (The Subaru Lya blob survey: a sample of 100-kpc Lya blobs at z=3): 
The authors took images with the Subaru Suprime-Cam of 12 fields in the sky looking for Lya blobs (LABs) at z~3. 
They found 14 giant (100-200 kpc) LABs in these images, which almost tripled the number of giant LABs known. 
When looking for overdensities in the images, they found that blobs that are more elongated and filament-shaped 
tended to be located in average-density environment, while rounder, more spherical blobs are found in both average 
and overdense environments. This suggests that blobs may follow a morphology-density relation.

Brodwin et al. 2015 (2016?) (IDCS J1426.5+3508: The most massive galaxy cluster at z > 1.5): 
The authors obtained Chandra x-ray data for the massive galaxy cluster IDCS J1426.5+3508 (which I'll call 
"this cluster" hereafter) as followup to previous studies that used IR and mm data. The authors then 
used four different scaling relations to estimate the cluster mass: x-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass, 
and Yx (the product of the core temperature and the gas mass). They found that the mass estimates from all 
four of these relations were in excellent agreement, and also agreed with two previous estimates obtained  
using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and strong gravitational lensing (M500 ~ 2.6x10^14 Msun). This 
consistency indicates that the cluster is relaxed, despite being at high redshift. The authors also 
discovered that the core of the cluster is offset from the x-ray centroid by about 30 kpc, which they 
attribute to the core "sloshing" around since the cluster grew so quickly. The state of the intracluster 
medium (ICM) suggests that this cluster interacted with another massive structure within the last 500 Myr, 
but that its cooling time was only 160 Myr. This means that this cluster probably formed very early and 
grew very rapidly to its current large size. 


for 2/11: 
Yang et al. 2009 (Extended Lya nebulae at z~=2.3: an extremely rare and strongly clustered population?) 
The authors made a blind wide-field narrowband imaging survey to search for an unbiased sample of Lya blobs at z~2.3. 
They found 4 diverse extended Lya blob candidates with continuum counterparts, all of which were spectroscopically 
confirmed and half of which are associated with AGN (suggesting that AGN may play some part in powering blobs but 
are not necessary to do so). The authors use their data to determine that large Lya blobs are statistically very 
rare objects at a redshift of z = 2.3, with a number density comparable to that of galaxy clusters in the nearby 
and high-z Universe. On the other hand, Lya blobs at higher redshift (z~3.1) in a proto-cluster environment 
appear to be significantly more numerous, suggesting that extended Lya blobs are closely related to clustered 
environments. Interestingly, two of the four blobs found in this survey are very close to each other, indicating 
that they may be part of the same dark matter halo and therefore might be located in a massive proto-group or 
proto-cluster of galaxies. These finding imply that Lya blobs occupy the highest-density regions of the Universe 
and as such may be the precursors of modern rich-cluster galaxies. 


for 2/18: 
Prescott et al. 2008 (The overdense environment of a large Lya nebula at z~=2.7) 
The authors use a Lya blob called LABd05 which was found without any a priori knowledge of its surroundings to 
probe the association between Lya blobs and overdensities in an unbiased way. Using the Subaru telescope, they 
made a sample of LAEs in the vicinity of the blob and found that LAEs were very overabundant in the blob region, 
about 3 times more dense than the field. Additionally, they detected evidence for a long overdense structure 
beside a cosmic void (underdensity). These results indicate that LABd05 also resides in an overdense region, despite 
having been originally found without any knowledge of its environment. To test the likelihood of randomly finding 
an overdensity and a Lya blob in the same region if the two phenomena were independent, the authors used model LAEs 
from a catalog based on the Millennium Simulation to estimate the expected frequency of overdense structures like 
the one near LABd05 and found that the imaging survey only had at most a 0.3% chance of randomly finding the overdensity 
if Lya blobs and overdensities were unrelated; in other words, the results of this survey strongly imply that large 
Lya blobs are linked to overdense regions.
