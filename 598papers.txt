Matsuda et al. 2011 (The Subaru Lya blob survey: a sample of 100-kpc Lya blobs at z=3): 
The authors took images with the Subaru Suprime-Cam of 12 fields in the sky looking for Lya blobs (LABs) at z~3. 
They found 14 giant (100-200 kpc) LABs in these images, which almost tripled the number of giant LABs known. 
When looking for overdensities in the images, they found that blobs that are more elongated and filament-shaped 
tended to be located in average-density environment, while rounder, more spherical blobs are found in both average 
and overdense environments. This suggests that blobs may follow a morphology-density relation.

Brodwin et al. 2015 (2016?) (IDCS J1426.5+3508: The most massive galaxy cluster at z > 1.5): 
The authors obtained Chandra x-ray data for the massive galaxy cluster IDCS J1426.5+3508 (which I'll call 
"this cluster" hereafter) as followup to previous studies that used IR and mm data. The authors then 
used four different scaling relations to estimate the cluster mass: x-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass, 
and Yx (the product of the core temperature and the gas mass). They found that the mass estimates from all 
four of these relations were in excellent agreement, and also agreed with two previous estimates obtained  
using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and strong gravitational lensing (M500 ~ 2.6x10^14 Msun). This 
consistency indicates that the cluster is relaxed, despite being at high redshift. The authors also 
discovered that the core of the cluster is offset from the x-ray centroid by about 30 kpc, which they 
attribute to the core "sloshing" around since the cluster grew so quickly. The state of the intracluster 
medium (ICM) suggests that this cluster interacted with another massive structure within the last 500 Myr, 
but that its cooling time was only 160 Myr. This means that this cluster probably formed very early and 
grew very rapidly to its current large size.
